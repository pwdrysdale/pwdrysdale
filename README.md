# Hey,

# I'm Pete.

# I'm a full stack developer. 

I have done some work in Node, React, Vue, Typescript and other technologies.

Take a look at my profile [here](http://www.heyimpete.xyz) - and in true dev form it needs an update.

Thanks for taking the time to have a look. Happy to take advice, and learn! (there's still plenty of that to do..)
