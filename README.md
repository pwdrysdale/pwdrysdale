# Hey,

# I'm Pete.

# I am looking to become a full stack developer. 

I have done some work in NodeJS and React, and currently looking to expand my skillset into GraphQL, Postgres, Bash and Typescript.

Take a look at my profile [here](http://www.heyimpete.xyz)

Thanks for taking the time to have a look. Happy to take advice, and learn! (there's still plenty of that to do..)
